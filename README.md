# data_analysis
The data altered here is from the following link - https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk

## Data that is being visualized
I decided to trim the data down so that it shows the estimated population of Weston County, Wyoming. What I am visually showing is the number of Male and Females within the ages of 10 - 79, from 2010 - 2017. 

## Library used
Pandas

## Visual Representation
Jupyter Notebook 

# Getting started
* First download Anaconda by following this link https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos (ensure that you are downloading version 3.6)
* Once installed navigate to your applications folder and launch Anaconda Navigator
* With the launcher up click launch on the Jupyter Notebook from the list of applications (this should automatically launch the localhost url in your browser)
* On that url homepage select new > python 3
* Within the new page you can type your python code and then press shift + enter to have the code you typed actually rendered within Jupyter Notebook
* Use the jupyter_inputs.py code inside of the interpreter
